This project uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate the price of European call and put options, taking into account parameters such as the underlying price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free rate, and volatility. Additionally, it simulates stock price movements using the Monte Carlo method, generating multiple paths and visualizing the potential price fluctuations over time.
